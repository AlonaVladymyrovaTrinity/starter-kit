# ViroReact

ViroReact is a library for developers to rapidly build augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences. Developers write in React Native and Viro runs their code natively across all mobile VR (including Google Daydream, Samsung Gear VR, and Google Cardboard for iOS and Android) and AR (iOS ARKit and Android ARCore) platforms.

# Documentation

[Documentation can be found here!](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/overview). Currently, the documentation has some issues with code samples and broken links. If you would like to help fix these issues, either submit an edit or [get in touch](https://discord.gg/H3ksm5NhzT)!

## Getting Started

If you are starting a fresh project with ViroReact, consider cloning one of our starter kits:

- [Expo + TypeScript](https://github.com/NativeVision/expo-starter-kit-typescript)
- [React Native](https://github.com/NativeVision/starter-kit)
- [Expo + JavaScript](https://github.com/NativeVision/expo-starter-kit)

# Examples

See our [Example projects](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/examples) page. These are a little old (~2019) but are a great reference point for how to use bits of the library.

# A little history...

ViroReact was originaly developed by the [Viro Media](http://www.viromedia.com/) company, but was open sourced in 2019. In late 2020 the Viro Community was formed to help maintain and move the project onwards, updating it so it could run with modern versions of react native, and start to add in new features. NativeVision now focuses on the project full time making sure the codebase is updated and ready for the future of XR / Spatial Computing.

We, as a community, owe a great debt to Viro Media and the people who developed this library originally. We hope to make them proud as it continues to develop and grow in the spirit of open source.
